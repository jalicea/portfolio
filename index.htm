  <p> This is my portfolio site. It’s probably going to be under construction for a long time. When I first start looking into design I really didn’t know what type of things I would be designing or even that I would be a designer at all. This is but a start, lots of mediums are slowly starting to merge and overlap with each other and I want to be right in the middle of that. Many people have ideas, some can bring them to life others need help doing so. I want to be the person that can take ideas and bring to the real world. </p>
